# TriangleProgram

**TriangleProject**, is for Code Standards/Metrics tools that is needed, since _playground_ files does not support it, this project has been created specifically for tools to maintain Code standards. Although _TriangleProgram.Playground_, will be used for Fast prototypes :) 

Open **Code Standards.md** for Code standards :)

Open TriangleProgram.Playground/**Contents.swift** for Code :)
